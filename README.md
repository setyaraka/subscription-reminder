# subscription-reminder
production-leaning MVP built with Next.js (App Router), Prisma, and PostgreSQL to help you track paid subscriptions and receive pre-renewal email reminders (H-3). It ships with simple CRUD, lightweight i18n, NextAuth (Google) sign-in, and a GitHub Actions scheduler that pings /api/cron/send-reminders.
